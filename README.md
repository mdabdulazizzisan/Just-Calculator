# Just Calculator ðŸ§®

This is a learning project I've done just to learn the basics of android development. 
I've used [`this tutorial`](https://youtu.be/PtvQwaUdYdw?si=yH4d2Vebu9qzoJ1y) to implement this project.

As the tutorial was basic and no exceptional cases were handled, I, myself handled some edge cases. Some are still unsolved and I'll fix them when I get time. 
You can contribute if you want to.
